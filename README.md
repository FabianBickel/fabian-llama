# Llamabian

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I experiment with creating my own personal assistant using Python and Llama 3.1 8B. This project is an exploration of natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), and the potential of large language models (LLMs) in building useful and interactive tools.

## Introduction

This repository contains my experiments and progress in building a personal assistant using the Llama 3.1 8B model. The goal is to leverage the capabilities of this large language model to create an assistant that can help with various tasks such as answering questions, performing calculations, retrieving information, and more.

## Features

- **Interactive Conversational Agent**: Engage in natural language conversations with the assistant.
- **Information Retrieval**: Ask questions and get information on a wide range of topics.
- **Task Automation**: Automate simple tasks like setting reminders, creating to-do lists, and more.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extend the assistant's capabilities by adding new modules and functions.
